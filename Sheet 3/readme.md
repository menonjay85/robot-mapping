# Differential Drive Robot Simulation

## Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation of forward kinematics for a differential drive robot and simulates its movement based on a sequence of steering commands. The robot's initial and final positions, along with its trajectory, are computed and visualized using Python.

### Objective

The objective of this experiment is to guide a differential drive robot from an initial position to a target position using a set of predefined steering commands. The project involves:
1. Implementing the forward kinematics equations for differential drive robots.
2. Computing the robot's new pose after each command.
3. Visualizing the robot's movement trajectory graphically.
